In this assignment you will implement a binary search tree.
Before you start coding consider the ADT and make sure you have all interfaces in place.
You do not have to make a generic tree; it is fine with a tree that can take integers.
The traversals mayalso return a string, you donâ€™t need to return an iterator.
You should build the tree it in three phases:
1.A binary tree
2.A binary search tree with add
3.A binary search tree with remove
Test driven development is well suite for the project since it can be broken into small simple bits that can be test on their own.
 Besides,it is a requirement that all part sof the code are well tested.
 When you encounter errors,it can be useful to see a graphical representation of the tree.
 To that end I have uploaded the source code for a simple ascii code printout of a tree, but you are welcome to make a nicer graphical presentation(it is not a requirement).
 Remember that in phase one there are no add or delete methods.
  This is because a general binary tree does not have a specific ordering.
  In order to create a tree you must manually do it by creating and combining Nodes.
